# Online Markdown Editor

Build a web-based Markdown editor that lets users write, preview, and collaborate on documents in real time. Think of it as a lightweight, browser-friendly alternative to [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/)—perfect for notes, docs, or blogs, with a focus on simplicity, live previews, and sharing. Add your own flair like custom themes or export options to make it shine.

## What Needs to Be Built

Create a web app where users can type Markdown in one pane and see a live-rendered preview in another, with features to save, share, and collaborate. It should feel snappy, work across devices, and handle Markdown basics (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.) with room for extras like file exports or real-time editing.

## Requirements/Features for Web App

### Primary features

**Dual-Pane Interface:** Design a clean layout with a text editor on one side where users type Markdown and a live preview on the other that updates as they write. Make it resizable or toggleable for flexibility.

**Markdown Support:** Handle core Markdown syntax—headings, bold/italic, links, images, lists, and code blocks—converting it to HTML in real time. Bonus: add support for tables or footnotes for power users.

**Save & Sync:** Allow users to save their work to the cloud with a simple account system (email/password or OAuth). Sync changes across devices so they can pick up where they left off.

**Sharing Options:** Generate a unique link for each document that users can share—options for "view only" or "edit" access. Add a quick "copy link" button for convenience.

### Additional features

**Real-Time Collaboration:** Let multiple users edit the same document simultaneously (like Google Docs). Show who's online and highlight their changes—think cursors or colored edits.

**Export Features:** Let users download their work as a Markdown file (.md), HTML, or PDF. Keep it simple but polished—maybe add a "styled PDF" option with basic formatting.

**Customization:** Include a few editor themes (e.g., light, dark, or a fun retro vibe) and font choices to personalize the experience. A distraction-free mode could be a cool touch too.

**Offline Mode:** Cache the editor locally so users can write offline, with changes syncing once they're back online—handy for spotty connections.
