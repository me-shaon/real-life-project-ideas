# Anonymous Feedback App

Create a web and mobile app that lets users send and receive anonymous messages—perfect for feedback, confessions, or lighthearted gossip. Think of it as a digital suggestion box with a twist: no names, no judgment, just honest thoughts. Add your own spin, like custom stickers or a public wall, to make it fun and engaging.

## What Needs to Be Built

Develop an app (web/mobile) where users can sign up, share a unique link, and collect anonymous messages from anyone. It should be simple to use, secure for privacy, and versatile—working online or offline with options to reply or showcase messages. The goal is to encourage candid communication in a safe, anonymous space.

## Requirements/Features

### Web App

**User Profiles:** Let users sign up with a unique username (no real identity needed) and get a unique, shareable link (e.g., "appname.com/username") to receive messages.

**Message Inbox:** Build a dashboard where users see all incoming anonymous messages, with timestamps and a simple layout—think minimalist and easy to scan.

**Send Feedback:** Allow anyone with the link to type a message (no login required) and send it anonymously to the user's inbox.

**Reply Option:** Give users a way to post public replies to messages (still anonymous on the sender's end) or toggle replies off if they prefer one-way feedback.

**Public Wall:** Add an optional feature where users can display selected messages publicly on their profile for others to see—like a curated confession board.

**Customization:** Include basic themes (light/dark) or fun extras like emojis/stickers to personalize the experience.

### Mobile App

**Quick Access:** Design a home screen showing unread messages with push notifications for new ones—keep it snappy and mobile-friendly.

**Link Sharing:** Make it easy to share the unique link via text, social media, or QR code right from the app.

**Message Input:** Let visitors (no account needed) send anonymous messages through a simple form accessed via the link—smooth and fast, even on spotty networks.

**Offline Mode:** Store messages locally so users can read them offline, syncing any replies or new sends when they're back online.

**Security Lock:** Add a PIN or biometric login to protect the app, ensuring only the user sees their inbox.

**Fun Features:** Toss in a sticker library or quick reactions (e.g., "haha" or "thanks") for users to spice up replies or messages.

### Shared Features (Web & Mobile)

**Anonymity First:** Ensure no sender data (IP, email, etc.) is tracked or linked to messages—complete privacy is the hook.

**Moderation Tools:** Let users delete or flag unwanted messages to keep their inbox clean and safe.

**Cross-Platform Sync:** Sync messages between web and mobile for users who switch devices, using a lightweight account system.

**Simple Analytics:** Show users basic stats like “10 messages received this week” to keep them engaged without breaking anonymity.
